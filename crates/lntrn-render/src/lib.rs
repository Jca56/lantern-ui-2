//! Lantern render: the wgpu wrapper. Device and surface setup, a small render
//! graph, the 2D draw-list pass that draws panels and glyphs from one vertex
//! stream against one atlas, and the shader preprocessor.
//!
//! This is the first crate allowed to touch wgpu (D011). Everything below it
//! tests headless; everything above it describes *what* to draw, never how.
